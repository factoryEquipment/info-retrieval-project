"description" : "A town resident allowed a friend to use her car for an emergency on November 25 2008. The friend was to return the vehicle the next day and did not do so. Several attempts to contact the friend and inquire as to the status of the vehicle were met with negative results. After a period of time contact was made with the individual and an agreement was reached regarding an actual purchase of the vehicle by the person that borrowed it. The payments were never made and therefore the victim notified police. This case is still being investigated." ,

The location was determined via an electronic system which identifies the location of an emergency phone call even if no verbal interaction takes place. Upon his arrival Officer Maiorana located several individuals and began investigating. The investigation revealed that some of the subjects were involved in a verbal confrontation with some individuals that claimed to be members of a gang. Detective Sheeran a Vienna Police Detective assigned to a regional gang task force was called and he responded to the scene. Detective Sheeran was able to determine that one of the individuals involved in the confrontation had made gestures which could be construed as implying a weapon. He interviewed all participants in an attempt to gather more information on the individuals involved. A short time later a simulated handgun was found in the grass near the Vienna Park Apartments. It is not known at this time if this toy gun was involved in the aforementioned incident. (See case  087118)" ,

"description" : "A 12 year veteran Vienna Police Officer responded to a crash scene on May 5 2008 at the intersection of Cottage Street and Cedar Lane. After arrival the officer determined that the crash had occurred outside of the actual Town of Vienna but stood by to control the scene until Fairfax County Police arrived. Some time later one of the involved parties accused the Vienna officer of stealing some items from inside her vehicle while she was on the scene. This story was corroborated by the passenger in the vehicle. An internal investigation was conducted by Sergeant Elias as the result of the formal complaint against the officer. His investigation revealed that the allegations made against the officer were false. Sergeant Elias determined that the driver had falsely accused the officer of this offense because she felt she was unfairly held at fault in the crash. Sergeant Elias conferred with the Commonwealth Attorneys Office and subsequently obtained warrants charging the driver/complainant as well as her passenger with Making False Statements to a Police Officer. The warrants are still outstanding pending the arrest of both individuals. Warrants are currently on file for: Sara Salajegheh 27 of Oakdale Crescent Court in Fairfax Virginia Zahid Mahmood Khan 34 of Mathes Terrace in South Riding Virginia" ,
