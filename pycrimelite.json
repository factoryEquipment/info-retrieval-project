description : A town resident allowed a friend to use her car for an emergency on November 25 2008. The friend was to return the vehicle the next day and did not do so. Several attempts to contact the friend and inquire as to the status of the vehicle were met with negative results. After a period of time contact was made with the individual and an agreement was reached regarding an actual purchase of the vehicle by the person that borrowed it. The payments were never made and therefore the victim notified police. This case is still being investigated.
