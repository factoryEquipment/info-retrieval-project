Just a repo to store my final project for Information Retrieval course at Virginia Tech.
Using Apache Lucene, we indexed crime data that we crawled from various local government sources. Then, through an android interface, based one one's location or a user chosen location, our search satabase returns crimes in a certain radius from that location.
